# Introduction

In Dark Souls 2 SotFS, souls serve two purposes. The first purpose of souls is
as experience points. The more souls you have in your soul counter, the more
times you can level up by means of the Emerald Herald. At various points in your
playthrough, you might find that levelling your character a few times prior to a
boss fight can make the boss a bit easier because you now have more HP, more
stamina, more Adaptability, or your weapon hits harder than previously.

The second purpose of souls is to serve as currency. Souls allow you to purchase
various consumables, weapons, armour pieces, upgrade materials, ammunition, and
services from various merchants scattered throughout the game. The consumable
item you probably purchase the most often is Lifegem. Prior to visiting a new
area, farm souls to help you stock up on Lifegem and restock your inventory of
elemental resins for buffing your weapons. Each of the two blacksmiths in the
game charges a certain amount of souls to upgrade your weapon to a particular
level. The blacksmiths also charge souls for repairing broken weapons, armour
pieces, and rings. Cromwell the Pardoner charges souls to absolve your character
of any sins committed, the amount varies with the soul level of your character.

Enemies in the game randomly drop various items upon defeat. These items include
consumables, covenant items, armour pieces, weapons, and ammunition. The dropped
items can be sold to Gavlan for extra souls.

In NG+0, the best setup for farming souls includes:

-   Nahr Alma Hood. Dropped by Titchy Gren upon death. Unfortunately, you must
    kill Titchy Gren for this head piece.
-   Nahr Alma Robes. Can be purchased from Melentia for 5,000 souls after
    killing Titchy Gren.
-   Jester's Gloves. Magerold sells this for 2,600 souls.
-   Tseldora Trousers. Dropped by Maughlin upon death. Don't kill Maughlin. You
    can farm the Tseldora Trousers from the Parasitized Undead and the Parasite
    Spider at lower Brightstone Cove Tseldora, unlocked after defeating the
    Prowling Magus and Congregation. Equip these to raise your Item Discovery:
    Watchdragon Parma, Covetous Gold Serpent Ring+1 (the +2 version is available
    from NG+1 onward), Jester's Cap, and Prisoner's Tatters. Pop a Rusted Coin
    if you have any.
-   Covetous Silver Serpent Ring+1. Gifted by Melentia after spending at least
    10,000 souls in her shop. The +2 version is available from NG+1 onward.

Drink from your Estus Flask as many times as possible. Avoid popping a Lifegem
unless absolutely necessary. Each Lifegem costs 300 souls. You don't want to
lose souls while farming for souls.

Unlike other games in the Dark Souls trilogy, most non-boss enemies stop
spawning after being killed a certain number of times. You have two options for
spawning such enemies infinitely many times. The first option is to burn a
Bonfire Ascetic. This respawns all nearby enemies and bosses, and raises the
difficulty of the game. The spawning limit still applies to most non-boss
enemies near the bonfire where you burnt a Bonfire Ascetic. The second option
for having non-boss enemies spawn infinitely many times is to join the Company
of Champions covenant. Joining the covenant does not re-spawn any boss, but your
membership of the covenant does increase the difficulty of the game. Regular
enemies now spawn infinitely many times without raising the bonfire intensity.

Some enemies in the game spawn infinitely many times without requiring you to
burn a Bonfire Ascetic or being a member of the Company of Champions. Such
enemies include:

-   The Stone Soldiers near the King's Gate bonfire at Drangleic Castle.
-   The Leydia Pyromancer at Undead Crypt. Those found in areas with gravestones
    can stop spawning once the gravestones are broken. The ones found in front
    of the arena of Velstadt continue to spawn as long as you ring a nearby
    bell.
