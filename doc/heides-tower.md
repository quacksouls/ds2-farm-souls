Start from the Tower of Flame bonfire. Equip the Covetous Silver Serpent Ring+1
and two-hand the Bastard Sword. Go to the arena where you fought the Dragonrider
and wait near the Old Knight for the wandering Heide Knight to approach you. All
Heide Knights should be aggressive toward you because the Dragonrider is
defeated. Fight the Heide Knight within the arena, then defeat the Old Knight.
If the Guardian Dragon is still alive, you should be able to summon Masterless
Glencour to help you distract an enemy while you look for opportunities to deal
damage or fish for backstab. Fight one enemy at a time and use the Short Bow and
arrows to lure an enemy toward you or Glencour.

In the rotunda where Old Knight x 3 are located, use the Short Bow and arrows to
shoot at the nearest Old Knight, then run to the entrance of the Dragonrider
arena. Two Old Knights would likely chase after you. Wait near the entrance for
one Old Knight to return to his original position, allowing you the opportunity
to fight one-on-one with an Old Knight. Let Glencour distract a Heide Knight
while you look for opportunities to backstab. Use the Black Separation Crystal
to send Glencour home. End your route at the Heide's Ruin bonfire.
